In the project “Decode the Vision”, I first learned the basics of Python programming. Along with this, I explored important Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which are widely used for data analysis and visualization. After building this foundation, I went through the course content to understand what Machine Learning is and how it works. I learned how to train a machine using regression techniques and how to use the trained model to make predictions based on data. During this process, sometimes the code worked as expected and sometimes it did not, but whenever I faced difficulties, I took help from online resources and the internet to understand the errors and fix them. This helped me improve my problem-solving skills and gain a better understanding of Machine Learning concepts.
